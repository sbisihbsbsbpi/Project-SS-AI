## 1. PRIMARY TECHNOLOGIES COMPARISON

### **Playwright** ✅ RECOMMENDED
**Developed by:** Microsoft (2020)
**Language Support:** JavaScript/Node.js, Python, Java, C#

**Pros:**
- ✅ Cross-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ✅ Multi-language support (Python, Java, C#, JavaScript)
- ✅ Parallel test execution
- ✅ Advanced features: multi-context browsing, browser extensions
- ✅ Better API design with automatic waiting
- ✅ Actively maintained with rapid growth
- ✅ Superior PDF rendering capabilities
- ✅ Better for complex, multi-browser scenarios

**Cons:**
- Slightly larger learning curve
- More dependencies

**Best For:** Production-grade tools, multi-browser support, enterprise solutions

---

### **Puppeteer**
**Developed by:** Google Chrome DevTools Team (2017)
**Language Support:** JavaScript/Node.js (primary), Python (pyppeteer - community port)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Mature ecosystem with strong community
- ✅ Extensive documentation
- ✅ Chrome/Chromium focused (simpler)
- ✅ Lightweight for single-browser scenarios
- ✅ Established best practices

**Cons:**
- ❌ Chrome/Chromium only (no Firefox, Safari)
- ❌ JavaScript-only (pyppeteer is community-maintained)
- ❌ Less advanced features
- ❌ Slower than Playwright in some scenarios

**Best For:** Chrome-only projects, quick prototypes, familiar teams

---

### **Selenium**
**Developed by:** Open Source Community (2004)
**Language Support:** Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, Ruby, Go

**Pros:**
- ✅ Longest-standing tool (most mature)
- ✅ Multi-language support
- ✅ Large community

**Cons:**
- ❌ Slower performance
- ❌ More verbose API
- ❌ Primarily designed for testing (not screenshots)
- ❌ Outdated compared to Playwright/Puppeteer

**Best For:** Legacy systems, multi-language requirements
