## 🎯 Key Features

### Viewport Management
- **Common Viewports**: 8 pre-configured viewports
  - Mobile: Small (320x568), Medium (375x667), Large (414x896)
  - Tablet: Portrait (768x1024), Landscape (1024x768)
  - Desktop: Small (1280x720), Medium (1366x768), Large (1920x1080)

### Issue Detection
- **Layout Issues**: Broken layouts at specific viewport sizes
- **Overflow Issues**: Content overflowing viewport boundaries
- **Text Issues**: Text too small to read on mobile
- **Image Issues**: Images not scaling properly
- **Spacing Issues**: Improper spacing at different viewports
- **Alignment Issues**: Misaligned elements

### Report Formats
- **JSON**: Structured data export for programmatic use
- **HTML**: Interactive HTML reports with styling
- **CSV**: Tabular data export for spreadsheets
- **PDF**: PDF export (uses HTML rendering)

### Visualization Formats
- **Side-by-Side**: Two viewports displayed side by side
- **Overlay**: One viewport overlaid on another
- **Diff**: Highlighted differences between viewports
- **Slider**: Interactive slider comparison
- **Grid**: All viewports in grid layout
- **Carousel**: Carousel-style viewport navigation
- **Timeline**: Timeline view of viewport changes
